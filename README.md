**delay**: Contains settings to control how much time (in seconds) elapses between broadcasts being displayed. The subkey "type" should be one of "constant" or "random"; the other subkeys should be used to configure the behavior based on the specified "type".

**prefix**: Some text displayed before a broadcast to indicate that the message is a broadcast.

**random**: Whether or not to display the messages randomly or in order.

**no-repeat**: If random is set to true, then don't repeat the same message twice.
